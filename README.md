Short Analysis Language Learning Machine 

The LLMs-Based Short Story Analysis Tool is a Python-powered software designed to analyze and evaluate short stories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool automates the evaluation of various linguistic and structural features in student-authored narratives, assisting educators and researchers in improving the efficiency and accuracy of writing assessments.

Key Features: 
-  Lexical Analysis: Word count, unique word count, and type-token ratio.
-  Morphological Analysis: Morpheme identification for root words and grammatical components.
-  Syntactic Complexity: Clause detection and subordination index calculation.
-  Grammatical Accuracy: Detection of verb errors and word choice errors.
-  Narrative Structure: Identification of story grammar elements (e.g., setting, initiating event, consequence).
-  Cohesion Assessment: Evaluation of pronoun usage and temporal markers.

Technology Stack:
-  Python (PEP 8 Compliant)
-  Hugging Face Transformers (LLaMA models)
-  spaCy, NLTK (NLP libraries)
-  Jupyter Notebooks (Development)
-  GitHub (Version Control)
